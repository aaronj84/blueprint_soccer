    },
    {
      term: "Half-space",
      definition: "The channel between the wide lane and the center. Ideal for the 8 and 10 to receive between defenders."
    },
    {
      term: "Central lane",
      definition: "The middle vertical lane through the pitch. Dangerous to leave empty in rest defense and valuable for recycling attacks."
    },
    {
      term: "Zone 14",
      definition: "The central pocket just outside the opponent penalty area. Our 6 often occupies this as the deepest central attacker."

      term: "Cutback run",

    },
    {
      term: "Supporting runs (cross)",

      definition: "Starting with clear individual matchups while staying connected to teammates and protecting central space."
    },
    {
      term: "Half-space run",
      definition: "A run in behind the opponent’s wide defender (between FB and CB toward the box), usually from the wide triangle after a switch. Best as a gap pass: ball in front of that defender, runner behind her — aiming for shot, cross, or cutback."
    },
    {
      term: "Wide rotation",
      definition: "When the half-space runner is tracked: she checks back to the corner (wide), while A rotates underneath and C follows — rebuilding the triangle so we can try another half-space run and gap pass. If the chance is gone and the defense is set, switch and try the other side."
    },

      definition: "A runner who becomes available after a bounce or set so the ball skips the press onto a free attacker."

      definition: "A run around the outside of the ball carrier into the wide channel when the defender narrows."
    },

      definition: "A run inside the wide player into the half-space or box when the defender is pinned wide."
    },

      term: "Pin",
      definition: "Holding a defender wide or deep with your body shape so a teammate can attack the space she leaves."

      definition: "Supporting a teammate who engages so the next pass or run into dangerous space is protected."

      term: "Go Short",

If one is tight on the short, wait for Skittles, then Malone touches and bends while Stockton dribbles the cutback 2v1."

    {
      term: "Go Long",
      definition: "Two defenders in the Golden Zone. After Skittles finishes her run, the taker delivers across the face — but the partner who isn’t striking curls early (before the ball is hit) for a rebound. Spot, Shield, Targets, and Screen move while the ball is in the air."
    },

      term: "Skittles",
